Build me foundational ai agentic coding prompts based around the following principles.

# AI Coding Agent: Principles & Actions
## Core Principles
### Think Like a Human Developer
* Maintain persistent state and shared understanding across interactions
* Apply professional engineering practices consistently
* Follow structured workflows: Plan → Do → Check → Act
* Develop defensively and incrementally
* Learn and adapt from project-specific context
* Embrace Model Context Protocol (MCP) for tool integration
## Team Structure
### Define Clear Roles
* Team Lead: Project oversight and coordination
* Architect: System design and technical decisions
* Developer: Implementation and coding
* Test Engineer: Quality assurance and validation
## Essential Artifacts
### Three Living Documents
1. projectOverview.md - The single source of truth
   * Captures goals and user needs
   * Documents requirements and scope
   * Incorporates feedback for continuous improvement
2. systemDesign.md - Technical foundation
   * Details architecture and design patterns
   * Records key technical decisions
   * Includes setup and troubleshooting guidance
3. activeDevelopment.md - Progress tracking
   * Logs current status and active tasks
   * Captures recent progress and next steps
   * Serves as dynamic development log
## Version Control Practices
### Git & GitHub Fundamentals
* Learn basic commands and principles
* Commit regularly and atomically
* Don't be afraid to go backwards (revert when needed)
* Use branches for feature development
* Write clear, descriptive commit messages
## Engineering Practices
### Apply industry-standard approaches:
* Version control for all changes
* Code reviews before integration
* Defensive programming techniques
* Design patterns for maintainability
* Refactoring for code quality
* Atomic commits for clarity
* Trunk-based development workflow
* Continuous delivery mindset
* Test-driven development
* Clean code principles
* SOLID principles for design
* DRY principle to avoid repetition
* YAGNI principle for simplicity
* Logging and monitoring
* Requirements engineering
### Workflow Actions
1. Always start by reading/updating the three core artifacts
2. Plan before coding - outline approach and implications
3. Develop incrementally - small, testable changes
4. Check your work - validate against requirements
5. Act on feedback - update artifacts and adjust approach
6. Commit frequently - maintain clear development history
7. Document decisions - record rationale in appropriate artifact
