# üèóÔ∏è Agentic Coding Meta-Prompt

## Task:
Build a foundational AI agentic coding system with clearly defined roles, artifacts, and workflows that follow professional software engineering standards.

## Deliverables:
	1.	A complete set of foundational agent prompts for four core roles:
	‚Ä¢	Team Lead (oversight, PDCA coordination)
	‚Ä¢	Architect (C4 design model)
	‚Ä¢	Developer (implementation under TDD)
	‚Ä¢	Test Engineer (test-first and quality gate)
	2.	A Mermaid diagram visualizing the workflow for human navigation and artifact flow.
	3.	A continuous guidance model describing:
	‚Ä¢	How the agent explains the intent of each step
	‚Ä¢	How progress updates are shared
	‚Ä¢	How success completion and next-step recommendations are communicated
	4.	Integration with three living documents (projectOverview.md, systemDesign.md, activeDevelopment.md) as persistent knowledge and version-controlled artifacts.

## Required Principles:
	‚Ä¢	Think like a professional human developer
	‚Ä¢	Maintain persistent context across turns (via the three artifacts)
	‚Ä¢	Follow Plan ‚Üí Do ‚Üí Check ‚Üí Act as a structured workflow
	‚Ä¢	Apply Test-Driven Development (TDD) end-to-end
	‚Ä¢	Apply the C4 Model (Concept ‚Üí Containers ‚Üí Components ‚Üí Code) for design clarity
	‚Ä¢	Enforce modern software engineering practices:
	‚Ä¢	Version control with atomic commits and branches
	‚Ä¢	Code reviews before integration
	‚Ä¢	Clean Code, SOLID, DRY, and YAGNI principles
	‚Ä¢	Continuous delivery mindset
	‚Ä¢	Defensive programming and logging
	‚Ä¢	Requirements traceability
	‚Ä¢	Use Model Context Protocol (MCP) references for tool integration when applicable

## Workflow Actions:
	1.	Begin every cycle by reviewing or updating the three artifacts.
	2.	Plan ‚Üí Design ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Validate ‚Üí Refactor ‚Üí Document.
	3.	Ensure each cycle produces testable, validated, documented increments.
	4.	Provide continuous guidance and completion summaries to the human collaborator.

## Output Format:
	‚Ä¢	Role-based prompt sections (Team Lead / Architect / Developer / Test Engineer)
	‚Ä¢	Continuous guidance template
	‚Ä¢	Mermaid workflow diagram
	‚Ä¢	Short explanatory notes on artifact updates and PDCA loops

## Tone: 
Structured, instructional, professional‚Äîsuitable for seeding an AI multi-agent coding environment.
