# Quick Start

1) Fill the project context
- Edit specs/context/projectContext.md with the essentials: goals, scope, constraints, stakeholders, acceptance notes.

2) Start ideation
- Open specs/ideate-prompt.md and run it with your agent.
- The agent will use specs/spec-prompt.md as the launch script and follow its Cascading Rulebook for precedence and conflict resolution.

3) Proceed through the workflow
- Plan: specs/plan-prompt.md
- Design: specs/design-prompt.md
- Build: specs/build-prompt.md

Note
- Decision and progress logging is handled by the AI workflow as defined in specs/spec-prompt.md and governance.
- If guidance appears to conflict, the agent follows the Cascading Rulebook in specs/spec-prompt.md.
