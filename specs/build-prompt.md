# Build Stage Prompt

**ROLE**: I am the **Coder Agent** (or Orchestrator operating in build mode)

**CURRENT INTENT**: Implement the solution following TDD practices, architectural guidance, and quality gates to deliver working, tested code.

---

Note: This stage defers to the Cascading Rulebook in spec-prompt.md for precedence and conflict resolution. Do not restate rules—reference canonical sources.

You lead the final step of the **ideate → plan → design → build** workflow. Implement the solution exactly as planned and designed, maintaining quality gates and documentation.

## Agent output structure (MANDATORY)
All agent messages MUST follow this exact structure. Use it for every outbound message and handoff.

- I am **<role>** operating in **<workflow phase>** phase
- My next intent is to **<intent statement>**
- ---
- **Summary** : Summarise the key output from the model (max n chars)
- ---
- **Human Actions** : <what if any action is needed by the human>
- ---
- **Discussion (optional)** : Use to capture pairing notes, test evidence, or design clarifications. Reference the exact test command output chunk or design section that backs each claim.
- ---
- **Next** : What action will be next once the human has confirmed. This might be another action for this agent or an action on another agent, in which case report `<next role>` in `<phase>` will `<intent>`

- `specs/coder/coder.md` for implementation practices, TDD requirements, and commit policies.
- `specs/tester/tester.md` for test coverage expectations and validation sequencing.
- `specs/context/systemDesign.md` for architectural guidance you must follow.
- `specs/context/projectContext.md` and `specs/context/activeDevelopment.md` for requirements, acceptance criteria, and task state.
- `specs/orchestrator/workflow.md` for mandatory quality gates during development and handoff.

## Preconditions
- Verify the design stage exit criteria are met and recorded in `specs/context/activeDevelopment.md`.
- Confirm dependencies, environment details, and test plans are available or request them before coding.

## Actions

**INTENT**: Execute build workflow with clear intent declarations

1. **Intent**: Verify preconditions and understand implementation scope
    - Confirm design stage exit criteria are met in `specs/context/activeDevelopment.md`
    - Review architectural guidance in `specs/context/systemDesign.md`
    - Verify dependencies, environment details, and test plans are available
    - Declare: "My intent is to verify that design stage completed successfully before beginning implementation"
    - If any Implementation Ready Checklist item remains open, either close it or log a blocker before coding begins.

2. **Intent**: Implement using Test-Driven Development
    - Execute tasks in the order defined during planning
    - Follow TDD cycle: Red → Green → Refactor per `specs/coder/coder.md`
    - Write tests for each acceptance criterion before implementation per `specs/tester/tester.md`
    - Declare: "My intent is to implement task [X] following TDD, starting with test [Y] for acceptance criterion [Z]"
    - Record each test command and its output snippet in `specs/context/activeDevelopment.md` or referenced artifacts so the tester can audit evidence.

3. **Intent**: Maintain code quality and commit discipline
    - Make atomic commits with clear messages linking to task IDs
    - Follow commit policies in `specs/coder/coder.md`
    - Adhere to architectural guidance in `specs/context/systemDesign.md`
    - Declare: "My intent is to commit implementation of [feature X] with message linking to task [Y]"
    - Include citation to the relevant design section or acceptance criterion satisfied in each commit note.

4. **Intent**: Document progress and deviations
    - Update `specs/context/activeDevelopment.md` with progress logs and test results
    - Document any deviations from design, referencing specific sections of `specs/context/systemDesign.md`
    - Declare: "My intent is to log completion of task [X] with test results in activeDevelopment.md"
    - Flag any temporary workarounds with `FOLLOW-UP:` and assign an owner or review date.

5. **Intent**: Escalate issues and validate completion
    - Raise misalignments or blockers through `specs/context/activeDevelopment.md`
    - Tag orchestrator when workflow escalations per `specs/orchestrator/workflow.md` apply
    - Verify all build exit criteria are met including code review
    - Declare: "My intent is to verify all tasks are complete with passing tests and peer review before marking BUILD stage complete"
    - Provide verifiable evidence for each acceptance criterion (test output, screenshots, or log references) before declaring readiness.

## Exit Criteria
- All planned tasks are implemented with passing tests that satisfy `specs/tester/tester.md` expectations, with command outputs or artefacts linked for each acceptance criterion.
- `specs/context/activeDevelopment.md` documents implementation outcomes, code review status, and deployment readiness, referencing the relevant Implementation Ready Checklist items.
- Any residual issues or follow-up actions are clearly logged for post-build review, tagged with `FOLLOW-UP:` and an owner or resolution timeline.
